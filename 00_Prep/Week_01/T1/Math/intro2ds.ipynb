For example, if data are bi-modal (with lots of low values and lots of high values) the mean will typically lie between these two clumps of data. Likewise, this can occur if a data set has a number of outliers at one end of a range (such as sales contracts that are much higher than the rest of the sales contracts in a list). In this case, other measures can provide more robust estimates. Some of the more common such measures include the median, the mode, and trimmed mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "The median is conceptually an easy measure of centrality; half the data lie above and below the median. Thus, to compute the median you first sort the data and select the middle element. While conceptually simple, in practice computing the median is complicated by several issues:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "The mode is simply the most common value in a data set. Often, a mode makes the most sense when the data have been binned, in which case the data have been aggregated and it becomes simple to find the bin with the most values (we will see this in a later lesson on distributions). A mode can also make sense when data are categorical, or explicitly limited to a discrete set of values.

The trimming process generally eliminates either a set number of points from the calculation, or any values that are more extreme than a certain range (such as three standard deviations from the untrimmed mean). In NumPy, the latter approach is used, and a lower and upper limit can be applied to eliminate values outside this range from being used in the computation of the [trimmed mean][p4].\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have a measure for the central location of a data set, the next step is to quantify the spread or dispersion of the data around this location. Inherent in this process is the computation of a distance between the data and the central location. Variations in the distance measurement can lead to differences in variability measures, which include the following dispersion measurements:\n",

    "1. Mean deviation\n",
    "2. Mean absolute deviation\n",
    "3. Variance\n",
    "4. Standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Range][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, the simplest is a range measurement, which is simply the difference between two characteristic values. Often these are the minimum and maximum values in a data set. While simple, this provides little insight into the true spread or dispersion of the data, in particular, about the centrality measure (since the mean might lie anywhere between the maximum and minimum values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the remaining four dispersion measurements are made with respect to a location measure, which is typically the mean value. Thus, the mean deviation is typically measured with respect to the mean value, as shown by the following formula:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",

    "While simple, one sums up the deviations from the mean value and divides by the number of points, this measure cancels out high and low measurements, producing a small value measure (which can be zero) for the spread of the data around the mean value. This problem can be overcome by using two different techniques: summing absolute deviations or summing the square of the deviations, which leads to the last three measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Mean Absolute Deviation][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "First, if we sum up the absolute deviations, we generate a sum of intrinsically positive values. This mean absolute deviation is also known as an $l1-$norm, or _Manhattan norm_. This norm finds uses in a number of situations, including in machine learning. The formula for the mean absolute deviation is simple:\n",

    "### [Variance][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if we sum up the square of the deviations from the mean, we also end up with a sum of intrinsically positive numbers, which is known as the $l2-$norm, or the _Euclidean norm_. This norm should be familiar, as it is used in the _Pythagorean_ formula, and it is also used in machine learning. \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Standard Deviation][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "One concern with the variance, however, is that the units of variance are the square of the original units (for example, length versus length * length). To enable the measure of the variability around the mean to be compared to the mean, we generally will use the standard deviation, which is simply the square root of the variance:\n",

    "\n",
    "### [Coefficient of Variation][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a dispersion measure can be confusing. On its own, a large or small dispersion is less informative than a dispersion measure combined with a location measure. For example, a dispersion measure of 10 means something different if the mean is 1 versus 100. As a result, the coefficient of variation is sometimes used to encode the relative size of a dispersion to the mean:\n",

Formally, the following pre-defined measures are commonly used:\n",

The two most prominent such measures are the [skewness][ws] and the [kurtosis][wk]. The skewness measures the lack of symmetry with respect to the mean value. Values near zero indicate symmetric distributions, while larger values indicate increasing asymmetry. Kurtosis, on the other hand, measures the spread (or how wide the tails are) of a distribution relative to the Normal distribution. Small values of Kurtosis indicate data that are highly concentrated around the mean value, while large values of the kurtosis indicate data that are considerably more different than the mean value.\n",

    "## Population or Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point, we have focused on describing a data set as if it stood alone. For example, you might have access to the full financial statements of a company or information about every transaction that took place in a given market. In some cases, however, you may only have a subset of this full information. This may arise when the original data is very large and you simply want to explore a subset of the full data, or perhaps you were simply given a subset in order to ascertain any issues of problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, this division can be described as being given either the full population or simply a sample. Traditional statistics, being developed many years ago when data sets were small and all calculations were done with pencil and paper, focused on using samples to make predictions (or estimates) of the full population. In practice, this introduces several new terms and small changes in calculating descriptive statistics. First, the originating data set is often called the _parent population_. Second, the process of selecting data from the parent population is known as _sampling_. This relationship is encoded in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Population to Sample](images/p2s.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a _sample_ to describe the _parent population_, we must account for the fact that we are using limited information to describe something (potentially) much larger. Thus, when we use a sample to estimate the _mean_ value of the parent population, we have reduced the information content of our sample. This means that when we use this _estimated mean_ value to compute the _estimated standard deviation_, we actually compute a less precise estimate. This is formalized by a concept known as _degree of freedom_, which is given by the number of data points in the sample, N, which is equal to the length of the data set in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can estimate the mean (or average) value of a parent population by computing the mean value of the sample ($\\overline{x}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^N x_i}{N}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have now used the sample to estimate one descriptive statistic, the arithmetic mean of the parent population, we have reduced the _degree of freedom_ in computing the variance or standard deviation of the parent population from the sample. Thus, we must divide the standard deviation estimate by $ N - 1 $, not $N$, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\textrm{var} = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{N - 1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We often use the sample standard deviation ($s$), since this has the same units as the mean value, which is the square root of the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\textrm{s} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{N - 1}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate this by using Python, we can simply pass in _delta degrees of freedom_ parameter to the `numpy.std` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "np.std(data, ddof=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another statistic that is often of interest is the precision with which we can measure the mean value. Intuitively, as the number of points in our sample increases, the precision should increase (and the standard deviation decrease). This is formulated by the sample _standard error_, or SE, which measures the standard error in quantifying a statistic. Thus, if we want to know the precision in our measurement of the mean, we can compute the _sample standard error of the mean_. Formally, this value is computed by dividing the sample standard deviation by the square root of the number of data points in the sample:\n",
